Dewi Brunet is exploring new folding opportunities through fabric pleating. He is using for this a very unique process, nowadays limited to a few craftsmen working mainly for haute couture.
This new folding skill enabled him to explore a new range of possible applications, including the creation of a “resilient dress” for pregnant women. For 2018 he obtained an annual grant from the TAMAT, Contemporary art centre of textiles of the Federation Wallonia-Brussels where he is able to develop is research.
